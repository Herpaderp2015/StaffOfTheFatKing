Q1.Help! i can't figure out how to run the game!
A1.There is a .jar file, you will need the most up to date Java Runtime Enviroment to run it (Older versions are not recommended), after getting Java installed, run the file with Java. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2.Whenever i open the .jar file, it pops up a window and/or disappears!
A2.The files in the game may misalligened, this means you should redownload the game or try to fix the locations of files.

Q3.What about this .docx file? I don't own Word and don't wanna!
A3.That is the game manual, please read it before you start. You can find a free application called Libre Office Writer, it's like a free version of word.
